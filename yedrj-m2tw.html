                            <p>anatolian principalities Прекрасно проработанный мод, посвященный войнам восточных иперий на этапе позднего Средневековья. CD Projekt Red наняли на работу моддера, создавшего Witcher 1 Prologue Remastered. last emperor Кампания повествует о временах падения Римской Империи и начала раннего средневековья. I have recently created a new subreddit for Medieval II Total War the name of the subreddit is r/MedievalIITotalWar I remember having so much fun playing Medieval 2 and I was pretty excited to use pikemen to defend some streets but instead they rather use swords than their pikes. Why? Spear wall is on. Also when going on the offence they also drop their pikes. 
 I played MTW almost religiously in 2003-2005. Just recently bought it again on Steam after not playing it for years since my disks wouldn't work on Windows 10 and it's still as great as I remember it. But it definitely feels dated now and I want to see what else this series has to offer. So I was wondering where to go now? I was thinking to do M2TW next to ease into the later titles, or would it be more enjoyable to skip the older ones? Preferably not Napoleon until later maybe, since OK, I really love this mod, but there is a big downside to it - turns are really really long. First 15-20 turns take 30-40 seconds to complete which is acceptable to me, but later on it increases to 3-4 minutes which feels like forever and it gets really annoying. Does anyone know how to fix this issue? Oh, and I have a gaming laptop which runs GTA V and TW: Warhammer on very high settings so I really doubt that this is a hardware problem. looking for a top down strategy game that you command your troops to defeating other nations while any ideas. Lets face it, most settlement/siege battles in TW games are very similar, barring regional culture differences. I think Rome 2 switched it up nicely, but I've always wanted a little diversity. Specifically, the settlement battles in Medieval 2 are very similar to each other with the same castle/city layout every time. Any suggestions would be great. 
What the title says basically, I know Stainless Steel allows the recruitment of some local, lower tier troops, but I'm looking for a mod that can let you recruit another faction's top tier units, after said factions has been destroyed or partially conquered. Out of all of the Total War games I've played, Medieval 2 is by far the best. From the amazing campaign to the intense battles, this game is just so fun to play. Although I love M2TW, I feel like it's time for an upgrade. Everything about M2TW is awesome, but the graphics and game mechanics are pretty outdated, therefor it would be nice to see a new version of this game with better graphics and improved game mechanics. M3TW should focus only on improving graphics quality, game performance I've been playing TW games since I was a kid, currently grinding Attila Total War, but I miss M2TW. I'm aware there are some pretty extensive mods that polish it up graphics-wise, and otherwise, what do you recommend? Thank. Hi, I'm kind of a new player here, I really liked the political/management part of the game, but I'm really anoyed with the battle controls, A lote of time my units dont do what I want, or there is this bug with enemy units when a single guy stays on top of the wall while all their mates are in the ground, and my cavalry refuses to attack them because the single guy in the wall make them think they are in the wall, etc. Anyway, I still enjoy a lote the game by managing my resources, moving. In battle you cound see those big flags showing unit status and those small flags when you zooming on them,mine had nothing,is there an option 
As the title suggests, I have an issue with M2TW and the night mode on windows. M2TW seems to override the display settings and reverses it to normal. Is there anyway to get around this to make the game as orange as my desktop? Thanks for any advice. I am furious. So I've been playing a M2TW campaign as Milan, trying to take the entire Italian peninsula while being as nice as I can be. Sicily is dumb enough to try to take Cagliari, that's fine, I crush them early on. Venice then thinks it's smart to attack a fully-garrisoned Milan, okay, say bye to your capital. I then sweep Rome in one turn and as I control the Cardinal College, the new pope is as happy with me as can be (despite now being devoid of any territories). I then use a crusa. Particularly with Third age, and such. couple old system limitations that i'd love to see a fix for, that Large Address Aware doesn't seem to fix Texture fix. larger resolution textures, like sky boxes have really obvious lines in them where they no longer match up lagging fix. the game gets laggy and stuttery, no idea why reinforcement limit. is there a way to allow reinforcements to not be delayed, and allow them to show up on time? this used to be because PCs couldn't handle I've found myself in several situations wherein an ally could've opted to help me against a faction with whom they are also at war, but they instead stand there and play stupid. When I coerce them to assist in attacking an enemy faction, they always seem to accept the coercion but neglect to actually live up to my request to provide military assistance. For example, I'm doing my play through as Scotland at the moment, and I have found that maintaining strong diplomatic ties with several. I'm enjoying battles so for, but i want to play campaign too, and i am lost in all that things you can do, i have done the tutorial and started a campaign with that advisor but i still not knowing Playing as Castille, Im doing pretty good for myself reconquering Iberia. I join a crusade for Jerusalem, I basically win this thing myself. Now at this point Im holding the Kingdom of Jerusalem and I have piety in the 5000s. Then Pope Dickhead XII decides he's gonna excommunicate me! I don't even have free investiture in my realm. He doesn't even hate me! (-3 opinion). Maybe I'll just replace you with my horse, make him the damn Pope, asshole.
